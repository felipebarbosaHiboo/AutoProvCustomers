AutoProv Service Provisioning System
======================================

AutoProv is a Django-based application that dynamically generates configuration files 
based on user inputs. Users select a service type, fill out a dynamically generated form, 
and the system creates a configuration file from a text template. The project also includes 
an autosave feature that preserves form data in the browser even if the page is refreshed.

1. Features
-----------
- Dynamic Form Generation:
  Based on the service type selected by the user, additional form fields are loaded dynamically.
- Template-Based File Generation:
  A configuration file is generated by replacing placeholders in text-based templates with user data.
- Autosave Functionality:
  Uses browser localStorage to auto-save user inputs so that data is preserved on page refresh.
- AJAX-Powered Field Loading:
  Additional form fields are loaded via AJAX without changing the page URL.
- File Download:
  Generated configuration files can be reviewed on-screen and downloaded directly.

3. Installation
---------------
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autoprov.git
   cd autoprov

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:

6. Access the Application:
   Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

4. Usage
--------
- Select a Service Type:
  On the home page, choose a service type from the dropdown. This triggers an AJAX call to load additional form fields.
- Fill Out the Form:
  As you type, your data is auto-saved in your browser using localStorage so that refreshing the page won’t clear your inputs.
- Generate and Download a Configuration File:
  After submitting the form, a configuration file is generated using a text template. You can review it on-screen and download it if needed.

----------------
- Project Settings:
  Global settings (like DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS, and database configuration) are located in auto_prov_project/settings.py.
